## Features

Our web application will implement a timetable planner and constraint solver for students in the Faculty of Arts and Science. This will be done through the use of the Cobalt UofT API. We use the Cobalt API in order to search for courses (given a course code, or part of a course code). Users may then select the desired course (and section, if needed), and view the closest conflict-free schedule generated by our program.

Unlike many pre-existing services that allow this, however, ShareSchedule will incorporate the power of Social Media in order to allow students to plan courses with their friends. ShareSchedule will allow users to log in with Facebook, and (if their friends have also used ShareSchedule), view their friends' timetables and attempt to maximize course overlap.


## Usage
* Simply search for and select a course by its course code in the search bar, and it will be placed in the list of selected courses.
* To attempt to switch section for a course, click on the course name in the list of selected courses, then choose a section.
* The application will attempt to generate the best (most similar to current) conflict-free schedule and apply it.
* The friends page allows users to click on their friends and then to view their friends' timetables. 
* The interface is also responsive. Try resizing browser window to a smaller width!
* Users may also chat with other users of the application under the Friends Tab. Simply type and send a message in the "Messages" box
