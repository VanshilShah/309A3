## Features
Our Web Application will implement a timetable and planner for students in the Faculty of Arts and Science. This will be done through the use of the Cobalt API. However, Cobalt API does not support cross-site Ajax. Consequently, we will not have the ability to query it for information regarding courses without implementing a back-end. 

The Web Application will also support users creating an account and a login page. However, without a backend database to keep track of user accounts and passwords, login features will also go unimplemented. The login menu (with partial functionality) is present, however.
