## Features

Our web application will implement a timetable planner and constraint solver for students in the Faculty of Arts and Science. This will be done through the use of the Cobalt UofT API. We use the Cobalt API in order to search for courses (given a course code, or part of a course code). Users may then select the desired course (and section, if needed), and view the closest conflict-free schedule generated by our program.

Unlike many pre-existing services that allow this, however, ShareSchedule will incorporate the power of Social Media in order to allow students to plan courses with their friends. ShareSchedule will allow users to log in with Facebook, and (if their friends have also used ShareSchedule), view their friends' timetables and attempt to maximize course overlap. However, due to a lack of a back-end (and hence a lack of a server in order to store information about friends), it is presently impossible to perform the above; however the above feature will be implemented in Stage 3 when the backend is created.

For now, there exists a "Bypass Login" button so that the course selection features may be seen without logging in; this will be removed in the final product.

## Setup 
* Setup a localhost to serve the files. DO NOT open index.html directly, as jQuery requires a server to complete http request to fetch local file contents used in Single Page Application.
* Run Chrome with '--disable-web-security' flag. For example:
```
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
```
This is to disable the Same Origin Policy as the Cobalt API doesn't support CORS. This will be removed in Stage 3 when the backend is created.

## Usage
* Simply search for and select a course by its course code in the search bar, and it will be placed in the list of selected courses.
* To attempt to switch section for a course, click on the course name in the list of selected courses, then choose a section.
* The application will attempt to generate the best (most similar to current) conflict-free schedule and apply it.
* If clicking on a section has no effect, this means there are no conflict-free schedule with that section.
* The friends page is setup as a placeholder (due to backend not implemented). Click on the 'Friends' button at the top right to view the login page, then press 'Bypass Login' to see a placeholder friends list and calendar.
* The interface is also responsive. Try resizing browser window to a smaller width!

The [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io) API is used to display the calendar.
